- Agent returns top 20
	- coax it to return all results, in some kind of order (chrono, alpha)
- implement memory (if it's not there already)
- Update front end to use `client_demo.py`


From Claude: (08/02/2025)

"Based on your setup, here are my thoughts on your next steps and platform choices:

## 1. Next Steps

Yes, creating a UI would be a logical next step. Here's a suggested progression:

**Immediate next steps:**
- Build a simple web interface that allows users to input natural language questions
- Implement a translation layer that converts natural language queries to your graph DB query language (likely Cypher if you're using Neo4j)
- Connect your web app to your MCP client to execute queries through the MCP server

**Architecture approach:**
- **Frontend**: Simple web form for question input and results display
- **Backend API**: Handles natural language processing and query translation
- **MCP Integration**: Your existing MCP client acts as the bridge to your graph DB
- **Query Translation**: Consider using an LLM to translate natural language to graph queries

**Tech stack suggestions:**
- Frontend: React/Vue/Svelte for a simple SPA
- Backend: Node.js/Python (FastAPI or Express)
- LLM integration: OpenAI API, Claude API, or local models like Ollama
- Deployment: Start with local development, then containerize with Docker

## 2. MCP Client Platform Options

You're right that Cursor's strength is in agentic code editing. For a production web app, you have better options:

**Better alternatives for MCP clients:**
- **Node.js/TypeScript**: Most mature MCP ecosystem, official SDK support
- **Python**: Good if you need data science libraries or prefer Python
- **Direct integration**: Build the MCP client directly into your web app's backend

**Why move away from Cursor:**
- Cursor is designed for development, not production hosting
- You'll want more control over the runtime environment
- Better performance and scalability with a dedicated backend service

**Recommended approach:**
1. Extract your MCP client logic from Cursor
2. Create a standalone service (Node.js or Python)
3. Expose it via a REST or GraphQL API
4. Have your web frontend communicate with this API

Would you like me to create a basic starter template for any of these components?"
